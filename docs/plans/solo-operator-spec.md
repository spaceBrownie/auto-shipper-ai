## 1. Purpose & Context

This document specifies the design, architecture, and implementation plan for an autonomous commerce engine built and operated by a single developer for personal use. It supersedes the general multi-user specification and reflects all simplifications made possible when the target fleet size is exactly one.

### 1.1 What This System Does

- Discovers demand signals from free public data sources (Google Trends, Reddit, Amazon PA-API) — uses marketplace data as **demand signals only**, then sources products independently from direct suppliers
- Sources products exclusively from **original suppliers** (manufacturers, wholesalers, authorized distributors) — never from marketplace resellers whose prices already include their own markup
- Validates willingness to pay before committing to any product
- Enforces a mandatory cost gate — no SKU is listed until all 13 cost components are verified and stress-tested
- Lists products across Shopify, Amazon, Etsy, and TikTok Shop via API
- Drives organic traffic via automated SEO and content marketing — zero ad spend
- Routes fulfillment through CJ Dropshipping, Printful, Printify, or Gelato with zero manual steps
- Monitors margins, vendor SLAs, refund rates (per-SKU and portfolio-wide systemic patterns), and CAC continuously via scheduled jobs
- Auto-pauses or terminates SKUs when thresholds are breached — no human intervention required
- Prioritizes highest-performing SKUs for increased visibility and listing prominence

> **Zero-capital model:** Every product is a listing hypothesis with no upfront cost. The customer's payment covers sourcing, shipping, handling, platform fees, and processing fees. The remainder is profit that flows directly to the operator's bank account. The only operator costs are infrastructure (~$6-12/mo) and subscriptions (~$45/mo).

### 1.2 What This System Is Not

> **This is a personal automation tool, not a SaaS product.** No other users, no multi-tenancy, no auth system, no need to scale to concurrent traffic.

Does **not** require:

- API Gateway or CDN — traffic is only from you
- OAuth / Auth0 / Cognito — no user login system
- Kubernetes or ECS — Docker Compose handles everything
- Kafka or SQS — Spring `@Scheduled` jobs replace all messaging
- Multi-AZ RDS — a single local Postgres instance is sufficient
- Redshift or BigQuery — your data volume fits in Postgres
- Terraform / IaC — `docker-compose up` is the entire deployment
- Amazon SP-API $1,400/year developer fee — exempt as a first-party seller

### 1.3 Engineering Analogy

| Pipeline Concept | Commerce Engine Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Pull Request | Product idea entering validation |
| Test suite (must pass) | Cost gate + stress test (mandatory) |
| Green build | `LaunchReadySku` — structurally proven profitable |
| Deploy to production | SKU listed on platforms |
| Production monitoring | Margin signals, refund rates, SLA checks |
| Automatic rollback | SKU auto-pause or terminate |
| Canary deployment | Listing hypothesis — list and see if it sells (zero cost) |
| Resource autoscaler | Priority ranking — winners get visibility, losers get killed |

---

## 2. Architecture

The entire system runs in a single Docker Compose file on one machine. The domain model is production-grade; the infrastructure is intentionally minimal.

### 2.1 Deployment Options

| Option | Spec | Cost | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local machine | Your Mac or Linux | $0 | Development and early operation |
| Hetzner VPS CX21 | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 40GB SSD | $6/mo | Always-on 24/7 scheduled jobs |
| DigitalOcean Basic | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM | $12/mo | Reliable managed networking |
| AWS Lightsail | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM | $10/mo | Easy upgrades if needs grow |

### 2.2 Docker Compose Stack

```yaml
services:
  app:           # Spring Boot monolith — all modules
    image: commerce-engine:latest
    ports: ['8080:8080']
    env_file: .env
    depends_on: [postgres, redis]

  dashboard:     # React — your personal UI
    image: commerce-dashboard:latest
    ports: ['3000:3000']

  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    volumes: ['postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data']

  redis:         # Rate cache + pricing signal buffer
    image: redis:7-alpine

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### 2.3 Application Modules

All modules live under the `modules/` directory. The entry point is `modules/app`.

| Module | Path | Responsibility | Key Types |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app` | `modules/app` | Spring Boot entry point, Flyway migrations, config | `AutoShipperApplication` |
| `shared` | `modules/shared` | Common value types used across all modules | `Money`, `Percentage`, `SkuId`, `DomainEvent` |
| `catalog` | `modules/catalog` | SKU lifecycle, cost gate, stress test, state machine | `CostEnvelope`, `LaunchReadySku`, `SkuState` |
| `pricing` | `modules/pricing` | Dynamic pricing engine, signal processing | `PricingSignal`, `PricingDecision` |
| `vendor` | `modules/vendor` | Supplier registry, SLA monitoring, reliability scoring | `VendorProfile`, `SlaRecord`, `ReliabilityScore` |
| `fulfillment` | `modules/fulfillment` | Order routing, tracking, auto-refund triggers | `Order`, `FulfillmentRoute`, `TrackingEvent` |
| `capital` | `modules/capital` | Reserve management, margin dashboards, kill rules | `ReserveAccount`, `MarginSnapshot`, `KillRule` |
| `compliance` | `modules/compliance` | IP/trademark checks, FTC rule enforcement | `TrademarkCheck`, `FtcComplianceRecord` |
| `portfolio` | `modules/portfolio` | Experiment tracker, scale/kill orchestration, priority ranking, refund pattern analysis | `Experiment`, `PriorityRanking`, `RefundPatternAnalyzer` |

### 2.4 Scheduled Jobs — Replacing Kafka

`@Scheduled` jobs replace all async messaging. No brokers, no queues, no dead letter handling.

| Job | Frequency | Module | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MarginSweepJob` | Every 6h | capital | Recalculate net margin per SKU; trigger kill rules if below floor |
| `SlaCheckJob` | Every 1h | vendor | Pull vendor fulfillment data; flag breaches; auto-pause affected SKUs |
| `PricingSignalJob` | Every 30min | pricing | Fetch live carrier rates + platform fees; recalculate prices |
| `DemandScanJob` | Every 24h | portfolio | Run demand signals via Google Trends, Reddit, Amazon PA-API |
| `ReserveCalcJob` | Nightly 02:00 | capital | Recalculate rolling reserve; flag if below 10% threshold |
| `VendorScoreJob` | Daily 03:00 | vendor | Recompute vendor reliability scores from rolling 30-day data |
| `StressTestRefreshJob` | Weekly | catalog | Re-run stress tests on all active SKUs against current live rates |

---

## 3. Core Domain Model

The domain model is identical to what would be built for a multi-user SaaS. Solo operation does not simplify the business logic — only the infrastructure around it.

### 3.1 Cost Gate — Sealed Type Enforcement

No SKU may be listed without a fully verified cost envelope. Enforced by the type system, not by convention.

```kotlin
sealed class CostEnvelope {
    data class Unverified(val skuId: SkuId) : CostEnvelope()

    class Verified internal constructor(
        val skuId: SkuId,
        val supplierUnitCost: Money,
        val inboundShipping: Money,           // live — carrier rate APIs
        val outboundShipping: Money,          // live — carrier rate APIs
        val platformFee: Money,               // live — platform API (pre-computed)
        val processingFee: Money,             // live — Stripe API (pre-computed)
        val packagingCost: Money,
        val returnHandlingCost: Money,
        val customerAcquisitionCost: Money,
        val warehousingCost: Money,
        val customerServiceCost: Money,
        val refundAllowance: Money,
        val chargebackAllowance: Money,
        val taxesAndDuties: Money,            // Shopify Tax API
        val verifiedAt: Instant
    ) : CostEnvelope() {

        init {
            // Enforce currency homogeneity across all 13 components
            val currencies = listOf(
                supplierUnitCost, inboundShipping, outboundShipping, platformFee,
                processingFee, packagingCost, returnHandlingCost, customerAcquisitionCost,
                warehousingCost, customerServiceCost, refundAllowance, chargebackAllowance,
                taxesAndDuties
            ).map { it.currency }.toSet()
            require(currencies.size == 1) { "All cost components must share the same currency" }
        }

        val fullyBurdened: Money = /* sum all 13 components */

        companion object {
            internal fun create(/* all 13 Money fields + verifiedAt */): Verified
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** `Verified` uses `internal constructor` — only `CostGateService` can construct it, enforcing that all cost data flows through the verification pipeline. All fee-based components (platform fees, processing fees, refund/chargeback allowances) are pre-computed into absolute `Money` amounts by the adapter layer before envelope construction.

### 3.2 Stress Test Gate

A `LaunchReadySku` cannot be constructed without passing the stress test. The type is the proof.

```kotlin
@JvmInline value class StressTestedMargin(val value: Percentage) {
    init { require(value >= Percentage(30)) { "Net margin below 30% floor" } }
}

data class LaunchReadySku(
    val sku: Sku,
    val envelope: CostEnvelope.Verified,
    val stressTestedMargin: StressTestedMargin  // compile-time proof of passing
)

// All five scenarios must maintain gross >= 50%, net >= 30%:
// 2x shipping · +15% CAC · +10% supplier cost · 5% refund rate · 2% chargeback
```

### 3.3 SKU State Machine

```kotlin
sealed class SkuState {
    object Ideation          : SkuState()
    object ValidationPending : SkuState()
    object CostGating        : SkuState()
    object StressTesting     : SkuState()
    object Listed            : SkuState()
    object Paused            : SkuState()
    object Scaled            : SkuState()
    data class Terminated(val reason: TerminationReason) : SkuState()
}

enum class TerminationReason {
    STRESS_TEST_FAILED,        // failed pre-launch stress test gate
    MARGIN_BELOW_FLOOR,        // live margin dropped below 30% floor
    REFUND_RATE_EXCEEDED,      // refund rate > 5% rolling 30 days
    CHARGEBACK_RATE_EXCEEDED,  // chargeback rate > 2% rolling 30 days
    VENDOR_SLA_BREACH,         // vendor delivery SLA breach
    COMPLIANCE_VIOLATION,      // IP/trademark/regulatory failure
    MANUAL_OVERRIDE            // operator-initiated termination
}
```

### 3.4 Money Value Type

Raw `Double` or `BigDecimal` are prohibited in all domain models.

```kotlin
data class Money(val amount: BigDecimal, val currency: Currency) {

    // All amounts normalized to scale=4
    val normalizedAmount: BigDecimal = amount.setScale(4, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)

    companion object {
        fun of(amount: BigDecimal, currency: Currency): Money
        fun of(amount: Double, currency: Currency): Money
    }

    operator fun plus(other: Money): Money {
        if (currency != other.currency) throw CurrencyMismatchException(currency, other.currency)
        return Money(normalizedAmount.add(other.normalizedAmount), currency)
    }
    operator fun minus(other: Money): Money
    operator fun times(factor: BigDecimal): Money

    fun marginAgainst(revenue: Money): Percentage
}

@JvmInline value class Percentage(val value: BigDecimal) {
    init { require(value >= BigDecimal.ZERO && value <= BigDecimal(100)) }

    companion object {
        fun of(value: BigDecimal): Percentage
        fun of(value: Double): Percentage
        fun of(value: Int): Percentage
    }

    fun toDecimalFraction(): BigDecimal  // value / 100 at scale=4
    operator fun plus(other: Percentage): Percentage
    operator fun minus(other: Percentage): Percentage
    operator fun times(factor: BigDecimal): Percentage
}
```

---

## 4. API Integrations — Solo Budget

### 4.1 Monthly Budget Allocation (~$60–75/mo total)

> **Note:** This is the operator's only cost. All per-product costs (sourcing, shipping, handling, fees) are covered by the customer's payment. The system generates profit, not expenses.

| Service | Purpose | Cost | Module |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shopify Basic | Storefront + Admin API + Tax (free to $100K) | $39.00/mo | catalog, fulfillment |
| Amazon Professional | SP-API — own account, dev fee exempt | $39.99/mo | catalog, pricing |
| Etsy Open API v3 | Listings, orders, receipts | $0 | catalog, fulfillment |
| TikTok Shop API | Product mgmt, order routing, inventory | $0 | catalog, fulfillment |
| Shippo Starter | Multi-carrier rates, labels, tracking | $0 | fulfillment, pricing |
| UPS + FedEx direct | Rate redundancy | $0 | pricing |
| Stripe | Payments, disputes, Radar fraud detection | $0 + fees | capital, compliance |
| Frankfurter API | FX rates — free, no key, self-hostable | $0 | pricing, capital |
| CJ Dropshipping | Full supplier API — products, orders, tracking | $0 | vendor, fulfillment |
| Printful / Printify / Gelato | Print-on-demand fulfillment APIs | $0 | vendor, fulfillment |
| Google Merchant API | Free competitive pricing benchmarks | $0 | pricing |
| USPTO Open Data | Trademark checks before listing | $0 | compliance |
| Google Trends RSS + Reddit | Demand signal ingestion | $0 | portfolio |
| Amazon PA-API 5.0 | Product discovery, pricing, BSR | $0 | portfolio |
| Google Analytics 4 API | Conversion + attribution | $0 | portfolio |
| Google Maps Address API | Address validation (10K free/mo) | $0 | fulfillment |
| VADER (local) | Sentiment analysis — runs on-machine | $0 | portfolio |
| SaleHoo directory | Vetted supplier research | $5.60/mo | vendor |
| Buffer | On-demand DataForSEO, ad spend, overages | ~$15/mo | — |

### 4.2 Adapter Interface Pattern

Every external API lives behind an interface. Swap any provider without touching domain logic.

```kotlin
// Implemented — lives in catalog module for cost gate; used by CostGateService
// Implementations: FedExRateAdapter, UpsRateAdapter, UspsRateAdapter
interface CarrierRateProvider {
    val carrierName: String
    fun getRate(origin: Address, destination: Address, dims: PackageDimensions): Money
}

// Target design — not yet implemented
// Tracking will live in a separate CarrierTrackingProvider in the fulfillment module
interface PlatformAdapter {
    fun listSku(sku: LaunchReadySku): PlatformListingId
    fun pauseSku(id: PlatformListingId)
    fun updatePrice(id: PlatformListingId, newPrice: Money)
    fun getFees(productCategory: String, price: Money): PlatformFees
}

// Target design — not yet implemented
interface SupplierAdapter {
    fun getProductCost(supplierId: String): Money
    fun placeOrder(order: Order): SupplierOrderId
    fun getOrderStatus(id: SupplierOrderId): FulfillmentStatus
}
```

> **Stale reference note:** FR-008 (fulfillment-orchestration) spec and plan reference `CarrierRateProvider` for tracking. The tracking concern now belongs to a separate `CarrierTrackingProvider` interface in the `fulfillment` module. FR-008 docs should be updated when that module enters implementation.

## 5. Margin Thresholds & Kill Rules

All thresholds are read from environment variables at job execution time. No redeploy required to change them.

### 5.1 Pre-Launch Requirements

| Requirement | Threshold | Action if Fail |
|---|---|---|
| All 13 cost components verified | 100% | SKU stays in `CostGating` |
| Gross margin | >= 50% | Terminate — cannot launch |
| Net margin (stress-tested) | >= 30% | Terminate — cannot launch |
| Stress: 2x shipping | Net >= 30% | Terminate |
| Stress: +15% CAC | Net >= 30% | Terminate |
| Stress: +10% supplier cost | Net >= 30% | Terminate |
| Stress: 5% refund rate | Net >= 30% | Terminate |
| Stress: 2% chargeback rate | Net >= 30% | Terminate |
| Vendor SLA confirmed | Required | Cannot activate vendor |
| IP/trademark check passed | Required | Cannot list |

### 5.2 Live Monitoring Kill Rules

| Signal | Threshold | Window | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Net margin compression | < 30% | 7+ consecutive days | Pause -> auto-terminate at 14 days |
| Sustained negative margin | < 0% | Any 3-day period | Immediate terminate |
| Refund rate | > 5% | Rolling 30 days | Auto-pause + alert |
| Chargeback rate | > 2% | Rolling 30 days | Auto-pause + compliance review |
| Vendor SLA breach rate | > tolerance | Rolling 14 days | Pause all vendor SKUs |
| CAC variance | > 15% from baseline | Rolling 14 days | Trigger pricing engine re-run |
| Carrier rate spike | > 20% | Immediate | Recalculate or pause |
| Rolling reserve | < 10% of revenue | Monthly | Block new launches until restored |
| **Systemic refund spike** | **3+ SKUs > 3% refund rate** | **Same 7-day window** | **Portfolio-wide alert; root cause analysis; category/supplier blacklist** |

## 6. Data Layer

### 6.1 Database Choice

| Option | When to Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite | Local dev, early stage | Zero setup, file-based, Spring Data JPA compatible |
| PostgreSQL (Docker) | Recommended default | Full SQL + JSON, Flyway migrations |
| PostgreSQL (managed) | VPS deployment | Hetzner Managed DB ~$12/mo handles backups |

### 6.2 Core Schema Entities

| Entity | Key Fields | Module | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skus` | id, current_state, termination_reason, version, created_at | catalog | Implemented |
| `sku_state_history` | sku_id, from_state, to_state, transitioned_at | catalog | Implemented |
| `sku_cost_envelopes` | sku_id, all 13 cost components, verified_at (UNIQUE on sku_id) | catalog | Implemented |
| `sku_stress_test_results` | sku_id, stressed amounts, gross/net margins, passed, tested_at | catalog | Implemented |
| `platform_listings` | sku_id, platform, listing_id, current_price, status | catalog | Planned |
| `vendor_profiles` | id, name, sla_days, defect_rate_pct, reliability_score | vendor | Planned |
| `sla_records` | vendor_id, sku_id, expected_date, actual_date, breached | vendor | Planned |
| `orders` | id, sku_id, platform, supplier_order_id, status, tracking | fulfillment | Planned |
| `margin_snapshots` | sku_id, date, gross_margin, net_margin, cac, refund_rate | capital | Planned |
| `reserve_account` | date, revenue, reserve_amount, reserve_pct | capital | Planned |
| `experiments` | id, name, hypothesis, source_signal, estimated_margin_per_unit, validation_window_days, status, launched_sku_id | portfolio | Planned |
| `pricing_signals` | sku_id, signal_type, delta_pct, received_at, applied | pricing | Planned |

All schema changes managed via Flyway in `modules/app/src/main/resources/db/migration/`.

## 7. Personal Dashboard

Served at `localhost:3000`. No login screen, no user management, no role system.

### 7.1 Core Views

| View | Purpose | Key Actions |
|---|---|---|
| SKU Portfolio | All active SKUs with real-time margin, state, signals | Pause, terminate, scale |
| Cost Gate Runner | Input product idea; run full cost gate + stress test | Approve to launch, reject to kill |
| Vendor Scorecard | Vendors with SLA performance and breach history | Pause vendor, view SKU impact |
| Margin Monitor | 90-day rolling margin chart per SKU and total portfolio | Drill into component breakdown |
| Experiment Tracker | Active listing hypotheses with validation window and verdict | Kill or scale |
| Capital Overview | Reserve balance, 30-day revenue, SKU-level P&L | View reserve health |
| Demand Signals | Latest `DemandScanJob` output — trending categories | Initiate new product validation |
| Kill Log | History of auto-terminated and paused SKUs with reasons | Learn from patterns |

### 7.2 Tech Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | React + Vite |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Tailwind |
| Charts | Recharts |
| State | React Query (TanStack) |
| API | Fetch to Spring Boot `/api/*` |

---

## 8. International Expansion Path

The `PlatformAdapter` and `CarrierRateProvider` interfaces already abstract country-specific logic. Expansion is an adapter implementation problem, not a domain problem.

| Phase | Markets | Key Additions | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Now | US only | All current integrations | Launch |
| 2 | Canada, UK, Australia | Amazon SP-API intl, Gelato local production, DHL Express | First profitable US SKU scaled |
| 3 | DE, FR, NL | EU VAT via Stripe Tax, VIES validation (free), Zonos landed cost | Consistent $X,000/mo net profit |
| 4 | Latin America, SE Asia | Mercado Libre API, Shopee API, Easyship cross-border | Validated demand signals in target market |

> Gelato is the highest-leverage Phase 1 integration even before international: 32-country local production means zero customs complexity for POD products at expansion time.

---

## 10. Open Decisions

| Decision | Impact | Options |
|---|---|---|
| Willingness-to-pay validation method | Shapes `ValidationPending` state | Typeform survey, Shopify pre-order, waitlist, manual |
| SQLite vs PostgreSQL to start | SQLite simpler; Postgres more robust | SQLite locally -> migrate to Postgres at VPS deploy |
| VPS vs local machine | Scheduled jobs only run when machine is on | Local for M1-2; Hetzner VPS ($6/mo) for always-on |
| Dropship vs POD vs both | Determines which supplier adapters to build first | Start with one; add others after first sale |
| Primary launch platform | Determines which `PlatformAdapter` to build first | Shopify — best API, most control, Tax included |
| Keepa integration timing | $54/mo but best Amazon demand data | Start with PA-API free; add Keepa for Amazon-focused research |
| Currency buffer in CostEnvelope | Needed for international expansion (Phase 2+) but not in current 13-component structure | Add as 14th component when Frankfurter API integration is built; not needed for US-only Phase 1 |

---

## 11. Operating Philosophy

> **You are not optimizing for revenue. You are optimizing for:**
> Durable net profit · Zero capital risk · Low volatility · Automated resilience

**Zero capital, always.** The operator never spends money on individual products. The customer's payment covers everything — sourcing, shipping, handling, fees. What's left is profit. The only fixed costs are infrastructure and subscriptions (~$60-75/mo). If the system is asking you to spend money on a product, something is wrong.

**Source from the origin, never resellers.** Marketplace data (Amazon, TikTok, Google) tells you what people want. Supplier APIs (CJ, Printful, Gelato) tell you where to source it. Never conflate the two. Buying from a reseller at their marked-up price and reselling at a further markup creates uncompetitive pricing, refunds, and customer churn.

**The system does the work.** Your job is to review kill logs, approve new product validations, and occasionally update thresholds. If you are manually processing orders, sourcing products, or writing listings, something is wrong.

**Protect margin before revenue.** A $0 revenue month with $0 loss is better than a $10,000 revenue month with $3,000 in losses. The stress test exists so you never learn this lesson the expensive way.

**Watch for systemic patterns, not just individual failures.** One SKU with high refunds is a product problem. Five SKUs with high refunds simultaneously is a systemic problem — listing quality, shipping partner, or storefront UX. The `RefundPatternAnalyzer` catches what per-SKU kill rules miss.

**The domain model is the moat.** Your proprietary margin benchmarks, vendor reliability data, and demand signals compound into an advantage no competitor can replicate by reading this document.

*Validate before scaling. Protect margin before revenue. Terminate weaknesses early. Compound strengths aggressively.*

## Changelog

### v1.2 — Zero-Capital Model + Sourcing Rules (2026-03-14)

Refined business model based on executive readiness assessment (PM-007). Key clarification: the system is zero-capital per product — customer payment covers all costs. Added source-level pricing rules and systemic refund detection.

| Section | Change | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Metadata | Monthly budget $80-100 → $60-75; added "Capital Model: Zero-capital" | Reflects actual operator costs; no per-product capital |
| Metadata | Status → "Draft v1.2 — Zero-Capital Model + Sourcing Rules" | Version bump |
| 1.1 | Added zero-capital model callout, source-level pricing rule, organic marketing, systemic refund monitoring | Core business model clarification |
| 1.3 | "Small-budget experiment" → "Listing hypothesis — zero cost"; "Capital reallocation" → "Priority ranking" | No budgets in zero-capital model |
| 2.3 | Updated portfolio module key types (`AllocationDecision` → `PriorityRanking`, `RefundPatternAnalyzer`) | Reflects renamed concepts |
| 4.1 | Budget $99.59 → $60-75/mo; added note that per-product costs are covered by customer payment | Zero-capital model |
| 5.2 | Added systemic refund spike rule (3+ SKUs > 3% in same 7-day window) | Portfolio-wide pattern detection |
| 6.2 | Updated `experiments` table fields (removed budget, added source_signal, estimated_margin_per_unit) | Zero-capital model |
| 7.1 | Updated Experiment Tracker view description (removed "budget consumed") | Zero-capital model |

### v1.1 — Post-Implementation Audit (2026-03-03)

Audited spec against implemented codebase (FR-001 through FR-005, FR-013). Changes reflect obvious implementation improvements; spec remains authoritative for unbuilt modules.

| Section | Change | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Metadata | Status → "Draft v1.1 — Post-Implementation Audit" | Version bump |
| 1.1 | "14 cost components" → "13 cost components" | Matches implemented CostEnvelope |
| 2.3 | Added `modules/` paths and `app` module | FR-013 project structure refactor |
| 3.1 | Replaced 14-field mixed-type CostEnvelope with 13-field all-Money version | Implementation uses pre-computed Money for all fees; `internal constructor` + factory pattern enforces construction via CostGateService only |
| 3.1 | Field renames: `unitCost` → `supplierUnitCost`, `freightCost`/`lastMileCost` → `inboundShipping`/`outboundShipping`, `modeledCac` → `customerAcquisitionCost`, `reverseLogistics` → `returnHandlingCost`, `supportAllocation` → `customerServiceCost`, `refundReserve` → `refundAllowance`, `chargebackReserve` → `chargebackAllowance`, `taxHandling` → `taxesAndDuties` | More explicit naming |
| 3.1 | Removed `dimWeightSurcharge`, `currencyBuffer`; added `warehousingCost` | dimWeight folded into carrier rates; currencyBuffer deferred to Phase 2+; warehousing is a real cost |
| 3.3 | Updated TerminationReason enum values | Implementation values are more actionable; added STRESS_TEST_FAILED, COMPLIANCE_VIOLATION, MANUAL_OVERRIDE |
| 3.4 | Updated Money (scale=4, CurrencyMismatchException, factories) and Percentage (0-100 range, toDecimalFraction, factories) | Matches implemented signatures |
| 4.2 | Updated CarrierRateProvider interface; added stale-reference note for FR-008 | Simpler interface; tracking belongs in fulfillment module |
| 5.1 | "14 cost components" → "13 cost components" | Consistency |
| 6.2 | Updated table names (`sku_cost_envelopes`, `sku_stress_test_results`), added `sku_state_history`, added Status column, fixed Flyway path | Matches actual Flyway migrations |
| 10 | Added currency buffer open decision | Deferred from CostEnvelope to Phase 2+ international expansion |
